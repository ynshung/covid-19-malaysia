## Source
Currently MOH does not provide a platform that provides **full** data on the COVID-19 cases in Malaysia.
Data are retrieved from multiple offical sources such as [Desk of DG](https://kpkesihatan.com/), [MOH Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/kementeriankesihatanmalaysia/), [CPRC KKM Telegram Channel](https://t.me/cprckkm), [Twitter of DG](https://twitter.com/DGHisham) etc. I cannot guarantee full accuracy of this data.

## Notes
* Since some death cases are reported after investigation are done that confirmed it is linked to COVID-19, the data are counted with the date of annoucement instead of date of patient's death.
* Blank spaces means that the values are not available while dashes means not applicable (roughly).
* The 'icu' column represents the current number of patients under the intensive care unit **at that date**.
* The 'pending' column represents the current number of pending cases **at that date**.
* The data on 14/3/2020 that provide the increase in cases by states are not consistent with the data given the day before. Ex: MOH provided 105 cases but only 92 cases in the next day. As such, numbers of cases on 13/3/2020 is calculated from the data the day before.
* On 16-18/3/2020, data of WP Kuala Lumpur is combined with WP Putrajaya.
